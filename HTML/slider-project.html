		<h2>About Project</h2>
		<p> Smash Burger is a web app that uses a MVC framework. It is built with Node, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. The logic of the web app is simply to add, eat, and delete burgers from a MySQL database and that is displayed in the web app.
			This was my first dive into using an ORM, in this case using Sequelize, as well as my first dive into MVC frameworks and launching a MySQL database to the cloud. The project allowed me to grasp routing, models, and controllers so while the actual function of the app is a bit bland, it was a project I definitely learned a ton from.</p>
