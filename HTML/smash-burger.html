		<h2>About Project</h2>
		<p> Smash Burger is a web app that uses a MVC framework. It is built with Node, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. The logic of the web app is simple: add, eat, and delete burgers from a MySQL database and that is displayed on the web app.
			This was my first dive into using an ORM, in this case Sequelize, as well as my first experience using MVC frameworks and launching a MySQL database to the cloud. The project allowed me to grasp routing, models, and controllers. While the actual function of the app is a bit bland, this set my foundation for learning databases.</p>
